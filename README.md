## This is a application done following Rust's introcuctory book

It's purpose is to recreate a very simplified version of the grep command
being able to search for text in files either in case sensitive, or insensitive
you can choose the case by specifing a environment variable, CASE_INSENSITIVE=1
on your terminal, to execute> `cargo run 'query' 'filename.txt'`
